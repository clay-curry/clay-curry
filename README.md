## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Aloha, dearest colleagues and open source neighbors! My name is Clay, and I'm casual software engineer with lots of love for tooling, optimization, and framework observability. 

I am currently looking for open roles with companies in need of an extra coder. I consider my ability to lift up other builders to the greatest privledge imaginable; and if I knew of a better future, then I would build that instead.

> wanna team up? [let's talk](mailto:me@claycurry.com)!

(could this be used to truly optimal bundlers?)

> I know something really magical is going on here, a fundamental algorithm bridging compilation, performance, composability, and primitives that conform to human intuition (not the needs of a CPU or most APIs). IF I'VE LEARNED ANYTHING about ideas, its that someone's likely already beaten me to it. If that's you, then consider me your biggest ally and [reach out](mailto:me@claycurry.com)!
