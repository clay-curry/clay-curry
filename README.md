### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I'm 24, Oklahoma-based, dreaming of more RAM and relocating near a big red hanging bridge
- 🌱 When I’m not submitting pull requests, I'm probably reading docs or taking notes on [Mastering PostCSS](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-PostCSS-for-Web-Design)
- 👯 I am always thrilled to get coffee, hit the gym, or work together on [something interesting](https://claycurry.com/#interests)
- 📫 Want to get in touch? [My email is easy to remember](mailto:me@claycurry.com).

- ⚡ Fun fact: camelCase is objectively better
- 😄 Pronouns: he / him
