### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ I'm 24, Oklahoma-based, dreaming of more RAM and relocating near a big red hanging bridge
- ğŸŒ± If I seem be taking a break from pull requests, then I'm either breaking someone else's code to understand it, or I'm doing some reps with theory because future Clay will thank me later
- ğŸ‘¯ I am always thrilled to get coffee, hit the gym, or work together on [something interesting](https://claycurry.com/#interests)
- ğŸ“« Want to get in touch? [My email is easy to remember](mailto:me@claycurry.com).
<br>

- âš¡ Unpassionate advocate for tabs over spaces
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he / him ğŸŒˆ
