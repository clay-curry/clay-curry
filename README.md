### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm 24, Oklahoma-based, dreaming of more RAM and relocating near a big red hanging bridge
- ðŸ‘¯ Imagine me casually sauntering to the edge of mathematics[^1] and formal language theory[^2], not out of a thirst for truth but a gratification to arrive to some impossible future where all things dull or mundane to me can finally be outsourced to a background process.

- ðŸ“« Want to get in touch? [My email is easy to remember](mailto:me@claycurry.com).
<br>

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he / him ðŸŒˆ
