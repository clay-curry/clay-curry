### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm 24, Oklahoma-based, dreaming of more RAM and relocating near a big red hanging bridge
- ðŸŒ± When Iâ€™m not submitting pull requests, I'm probably reading docs or taking notes on [Mastering PostCSS](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-PostCSS-for-Web-Design)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for opportunities to work with forward-thinkers on tech-related projects to benefit the lives of more people than I can imagine so we can all be a little nicer.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [website](https://claycurry.com).
<br>

- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm graduating in two months with my degree in CS, but I completed my homework about two weeks ago. 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he / him
