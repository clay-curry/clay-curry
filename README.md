### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm 24, Oklahoma-based, dreaming of more RAM and relocating near a big red hanging bridge
- ðŸŒ± If I seem be taking a break from pull requests, then I'm either breaking someone else's code to understand it, or I'm jogging around in theory[^1] because future Clay will thank me later
- ðŸ‘¯ I am always thrilled to get coffee, hit the gym, or work together on [something interesting](https://claycurry.com/#interests)
- ðŸ“« Want to get in touch? [My email is easy to remember](mailto:me@claycurry.com).
